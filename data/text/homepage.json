        "<p><i>Imagine that you have just completed a public consultation event. You published an online survey and received over 1000 responses from Canadian citizens. You are now faced with a large and complex spreadsheet of survey responses and need to create a report and present actionable recommendations. How do you get there?</i></p><p>This guide is intended to promote data literacy for Government of Canada employees who are engaging in delivering public consultations and/or incorporating their results into decision-making processes.</p><p>The feedback that you collect from citizens during public consultations is valuable data that needs to be effectively managed so that it can inform decision-making. While there are many important activities that go into planning and executing a public consultation event (whether it be online or in person), the work does not stop once the event is complete. You may end up with large volumes of citizen feedback (data) in a variety of (structured and unstructured) formats. By possessing a strong foundation in data literacy, you will be better able to translate this complex data into actionable knowledge, leading to more informed decision-making.</p>"
