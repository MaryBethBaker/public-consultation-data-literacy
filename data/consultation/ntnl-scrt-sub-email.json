According to Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals Judge Liles Burke – also the President of the Alabama Appellate Judges Association – appropriations to the judiciary have “gone down for the past 8 years, with the 2016 budget being several million dollars less than it was even in 2009.” Judge Burke explains that “[t]he only way that the judiciary has been able to operate within the monies prescribed for it is by eliminating personnel, increasing efficiencies through technology, and extraordinary efforts by court personnel.” Despite these measures, the courts and people are feeling the toll. Judge Burke laments, “[o]ur courts are now at a point where we have less than even the essential staff to maintain operations,” resulting in an incapacitated court system in which “[c]rime victims and their families agonize longer waiting for justice to be served,” and small businesses “cannot timely resolve open accounts and other business conflicts, thus stifling job creation.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are not supposed to be refusing to acknowledge Heads of State (mishandling of public affairs is increasing along with breach of Mandates) either loss of life over this is already considerable again, moreover, Mr. Mulroney has also been (Canada Revenue Agency as well) one of these matters on Alan Rock!!\n\n\nFrom what we have seen so far I doubt anyone impressed now I need to hear back from you on this I also doubt most normal people are very concerned with this much incompetence this early in this government though either!\n\n\nNo legislative standards being met, none just mindless mishandling of public affairs and we are experiencing high than normal rates of domestic violence!\n\n\n \t\n\t \t\n\t \t\n\t\n \t\n\t \t\nPrince's Charities has accepted your invitation\t\n \t\n\t\n \t\n\t <http://www.linkedin.com/blink?simpleRedirect=0PcjwVcj0VdzcZh4BOpm9JpmQCd31vpnhFtCVFnThMpmdzojRHpioMbmZQrSxMnSZOs2RAsC5znSpLsD0Jt71zolZSrCBvrmRLoORIrmkZpSVFqSdxsDgCgkAOoQV5qkhoplp5kk4ZrClHrRhAqmQCtD1KfngCt38JdPlTpSRWuCwJs3tOenEZpjYOtyZBbSRLoOVKqmhBqSVFr2VTtTsLbPFMt7hE&msgID=I60306954_116&markAsRead=> \t \t\n\t\n\t\n\t \t\n\tPrince's Charities Canada\t\n \t\n\t\nCanadian Charitable Work at Prince's Charities Canada (PCC)\t\n\n\t\n \t\n\t\n \t\n\t <http://www.linkedin.com/blink?simpleRedirect=3cNe3ANc3AScPR4in9BoCRBrioQc5ZBt6BSrCBvt71BoSdxfmJB9z0JonhznSZOs2RAsC5znSpLsD0Jt71zolZSrCBvrmRLoORIrmkZpSVFqSdxsDgCgkAOoQV5qkhoplp5kk4ZrClHrRhAqmQCtD1KfngCt38JdPlTpSRWuCwJs3tOenEZpjYOtyZBbSRLoOVKqmhBqSVFr2VTtTsLbPFMt7hE&msgID=I60306954_116&markAsRead=> \nView profile\t \t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n \t\n\t\nSend a message\t\n\t\n\t\n \t\n\t\n\t \t\n\t\n\t \t\n\t\nYou are receiving Accepted invitations emails.

The Sentry is a collaboration between the ENOUGH Project and Not On Our Watch, with their implementing partner the Center for Advanced Defense Studies.\nThe Sentry will release a report summarizing the results of nearly two years of following the money in South Sudan’s shadowy war economy and the links to an array of international facilitators and enablers, which include bankers, arms dealers, and businessmen. This will be the first public presentation of The Sentry’s multi-country investigations into the links between massive corruption and armed conflict.\nThe Sentry brings together an experienced team of investigators, including former employees of the FBI, Treasury Department, other government agencies, intelligence communities, and Congress, as well as contributions from field researchers, country experts, academia and press. Researchers pored through thousands of pages of legal records, corporate filings, financial statements, transaction and shipping documents, and other official correspondence; tracked suspects’ online social media footprints; and utilized satellite imagery to gather and analyze data about their assets and movements. Investigators traveled to multiple locations including Melbourne, Adelaide, Addis Ababa, Kampala, Juba, Cairo and Nairobi, to gather evidence and interview hundreds of experts and eyewitnesses, many of whom spoke under the condition of anonymity.\nLOCATION: THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB, Holeman Lounge ? 529 14th Street, NW, Washington, DC 20045\nDATE/TIME: Monday, September 12, 2016? 10:00am – 11:00am ET\nLIVESTREAM: For media unable to attend the press conference in person, a livestream of the event of the event will begin at 10:00 am ET at www.thesentry.org/live.\nFrom: https://www.looktothestars.org/news/15715-george-clooney-and-don-cheadle-to-help-present-results-of-investigation-into-war-profiteers \nRelated past articles\n*   George Clooney To Host MPTF's 95th Anniversary Celebration\n*   Ed Asner To Host Poker Tournament And Celebrity Casino Night For Autism Speaks\n*   George Clooney And Elie Wiesel Open Nominations For $1 Million Global Humanitarian Award\n  ________________________________  \nAre you organizing an event which celebrities will attend?

Mayor Tony Scully dedicate new Dream Court at Boys & Girls Clubs of the Midlands-Jackson Teen Center\nThe new court was officially opened at the Boys & Girls Clubs of the Midlands—Jackson Teen Center in a dedication ceremony on Aug. 30. The gym, located at the former Jackson High School, has not been renovated in more than 30 years, and this was the first step in the vision to create a world-class facility, according to Carter Clark, President and CPO of the Boys & Girls Clubs of the Midlands.\nDream Courts are top-quality, multipurpose play spaces built with the goal of providing children in underprivileged communities a safe area to play basketball, interact socially, and learn important lessons about teamwork and good sportsmanship. The Jackson Teen Center Dream Court is the 29th court installed to date in communities across the country and the first indoor court.\nThe dedication ceremony was opened with the presentation of colors by the Camden High School ROTC. Clark then thanked Superintendent, Kershaw County school district Dr. Frank Morgan and his advisory board in attendance for challenging the community and the BGC Midlands to bring the court to the center, where more than 1,000 kids are served each day. Dr. Morgan spoke passionately, “We’ve built a place for young people to be their best and a model for how business is done. We’ve had the vision for what IS possible, instead of what is NOT possible.”\nCamden Mayor Tony Scully addressed the youth and guests in attendance, “We’ve been wonderfully blessed today. Blessed with an extraordinary center for progress and success. On behalf of the city of Camden, we embrace this center and the new Dream Court.”\nBryan Mayes, director of the Jackson Teen Center, offered his thanks to the WorldVentures Foundation and Nancy Lieberman Charities, “You didn’t just build a floor today. When this center first opened two years ago, we had 28 high school Seniors, and all 28 graduated and went on to college. Last year every one of our Seniors also went on to college or joined the military.” And he challenged the teens in attendance, “You have no excuse now not to be the very best that you can be.”\nDuring the dedication, Nancy Lieberman said, “It is up to us to create intentional greatness. And that takes great teammates.” She spoke lovingly of her friend and mentor Muhammad Ali who inspired her to teach that, “You must love you. You must believe in you. And as you move forward in life, you must lift as you rise.”\nLieberman, a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, made history last summer when she was hired by the Sacramento Kings, becoming just the second female assistant coach in NBA history. She broke down gender and cultural barriers at the young age of 11 when she first started playing basketball at Rucker Park in the Harlem neighborhood of New York City. Following the ribbon-cutting she officially opened the court with her signature half-court backwards shot accompanied by members of the WorldVentures Foundation, city officials and members of the Camden community, members of the Boys & Girls Clubs of the Midlands and Jackson Teen Center and local representatives from WorldVentures.\nFrom: https://www.looktothestars.org/news/15710-worldventures-foundation-and-nancy-lieberman-charities-give-new-dream-court \nRelated past articles\n*   Billy Idol Performs At Prostate Cancer Foundation Gala\n*   Lonnie Ali To Be Honored At Celebrity Fight Night In Italy\n*   WorldVentures Joins Dallas Cowboys Linebacker Sean Lee's Sacks For Kids\n  ________________________________  \nExplore celebrities by social reach, cause, location, field and more with Insider Access ? \n\nRead in browser »\n <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=306eec49b0&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=2aec72c04e&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=856d193066&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=f92c0caf8e&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=036e8010f4&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=e8c7898015&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=2e59109141&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=77510befc2&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=6a38234349&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=d6bea3a52b&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=af5aae149e&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=a148bbc205&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=e171dbe079&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=c9dffc2b99&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=ebbe025d52&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=b779254663&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=920d582ba8&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=a68671b6bd&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=243a942194&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=36a49b3f80&e=a39ca331ca>  \n\n\nMajor League All-Stars Host Off-Season Fundraising Golf Tournament\nSep 07, 2016 10:30 am\n\n \nA pair of Major League All-Stars, Dexter Fowler of the Chicago Cubs and Bryce Harper of the Washington Nationals, are looking for a full-house when they co-host the Major League Baseball Players Trust's 13th annual fundraising golf tournament and third annual MGM Grand Poker Tournament to benefit the Players Trust in Las Vegas, January 11 & 12, 2017.\nIn addition to a day of golf at Bear’s Best Las Vegas on January 12, participating players will join Trust supporters when Tia’s Hope presents the third annual MGM Grand Poker Tournament to benefit the Players Trust on Wednesday evening, January 11.

SIR IVAN entered the radio chart in August along with Selena Gomez, Bob Sinclar, Usher and Calvin Harris.\nIn the U.S., John Lennon’s adopted home, “Imagine” by SIR IVAN coincidentally also ranks # 9 on the DJ Times National Dance/Crossover Top 40 Chart. The DJ Times is the oldest and most respected magazine for professional DJs in America. SIR IVAN entered the club chart along with Justin Timberlake, Justin Bieber, Sia, Sean Paul and Rihanna.\nNew Zealand based SERATO’S promotion division, Serato White Label, ranks “Imagine” by SIR lVAN # 1 for the greatest amount of DJ downloads during the month of July. SERATO is the leading DJ equipment and software manufacturer in the world. Although SIR IVAN sits on the top of the chart, he was also joined by Gwen Stefani, M.I.A. and Imany.\nSIR IVAN’s new electronic dance music (EDM) version of Imagine spent weeks on the Billboard Dance Club Chart. The song was co-produced by Grammy Award winner Omar Akram and legendary music arranger Peter Rafelson. It has been praised globally and fans of both the original and the new are dancing and working out to the most iconic peace song ever written. “Imagine” is the first single released off SIR IVAN’s new 10 song album called Peaceman Shines. Each of the 10 songs, created by 10 different producers, are well known anti-war or peace songs from the 60s and early 70s, except for two original songs, co-written by SIR IVAN, that share the same theme.\nThis is not the first time SIR IVAN has released an uptempo version of “Imagine.” He did so on September 4th, 2001, exactly one week before September 11th, when he launched his music career and became the first recording artist in history to turn any slow ballad of the Beatles or John Lennon into an uptempo dance record. Personally signed to the Tommy Boy label by its owner, Tom Silverman, SIR IVAN’s revolutionary fast paced version of “Imagine” became an instant Top 40 hit on the Billboard Dance Club Chart. This proved that even thirty years after the original was released by John Lennon in 1971, the lyrics of “Imagine” were just as relevant to a whole new generation. Now, 15 years after SIR IVAN first turned the ballad into a dance record, and because terrorist attacks are occurring all over the world, he is once again giving the planet an opportunity to heal itself through the therapeutic power of music. He urges us to come together as one, while raising money for a worthy cause.\nIn 2005, SIR IVAN, son of Auschwitz survivor Siggi B. Wilzig, created The Peaceman Foundation, a charity that donates funds to other non-profit organizations that help people suffering from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a debilitating mental condition that often results from exposure to severe acts of violence, such as physical attacks against members of the LGBT community, atrocities of war and terrorism. SIR IVAN has seen firsthand what survivors go through. His own father suffered from classic PTSD symptoms; fierce headaches, flashbacks, nightmares and depression, as a result of brutal beatings in the concentration camps and the murder of 59 members of his family during the Holocaust.

The results of the poll were presented to the UNSG by Bertrand Bainvel, the UNICEF Representative to Myanmar, at a meeting on 31 August.\nIn a Facebook message to U-Reporters, Ban Ki-moon said: “Thank you for sharing with me what matters most to you – education and employment, peace and reconciliation, and youth empowerment and participation. I will give them all the importance they deserve in all my meetings during my visit in Myanmar. Keep using U-Report and ask your friends to join. Your views matters to all of us.”\nAdolescents and young people were asked via Facebook, a series of questions relating to peace and development in Myanmar. Asked what would most contribute to peace in Myanmar, U-Reporters put at the top of the list: ‘unity’, ‘trust’, and ‘understanding each other’. They placed high hopes on the 21st Century Panglong Conference. It was clear to them that politicians alone cannot make peace happen, but that young people also have an important role to play by ending hate speech, fighting discrimination, and campaigning for peace, including through social media.\nU-Report was launched in Myanmar on 18 August 2016. Already almost 2,000 Myanmar U-Reporters have registered through Facebook and the numbers are growing every day. It is expected to reach 100,000 by the end of 2017.\nIn Myanmar, U-Report is currently available through Facebook, however discussions are ongoing with telecom operators to join the platform.\n“It is essential that we expand the platform to make it available to the most vulnerable, particularly young people living in conflict-affected and remote areas without access to internet, so that they too have the opportunity to contribute to polls, debates and to report on the conditions faced in their communities” said UNICEF Representative to Myanmar Bertrand Bainvel.\n“SMS is the only means of communication in some parts of Myanmar – we call on the social responsibility of all three major telecom operators to join us and support the platform. Without their support millions of young people will remain invisible and ignored” he concluded.\nFrom: https://www.looktothestars.org/news/15711-ban-ki-moon-engages-with-youth-in-myanmar-on-peace-and-reconciliation \nRelated past articles\n*   Zade Dirani Named UNICEF Regional Ambassador For The Middle East And North Africa\n*   Brett Ratner Launches New Initiative With The United Nations At Star-Studded Event\n*   Fans Of Olympic And Paralympic Games Urged To Help Protect Children\n  ________________________________  \nAdvertise your company to our engaged yearly audience of millions ? \n\nRead in browser »\n <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=df102388bc&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=679c5980a9&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=28a7babdbd&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=7882e0bbb4&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=5c647419c5&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=02d75e5383&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=72035af7fa&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=a5e6426d5b&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=fc30f72413&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=1aa0007f87&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage2.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=f09bb75d8e&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=81724347b5&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=c78b77f25b&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=ec275f8b67&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=f3769065bb&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=df269b8600&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=656b790e51&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=f8218d3f43&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=ea52aea0fc&e=a39ca331ca>   <http://looktothestars.us8.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=723fa135d3f434daa2107dcb2&id=5f9953a65f&e=a39ca331ca>  \n\n\nSpotlight: Prince Harry's Charity Work\nSep 07, 2016 06:00 am\n\n\nPrince Harry co-founded the charity Sentebale with Lesotho’s Prince Seeiso to help the orphans of Lesotho.\nIn 2009, he co-founded The Foundation of Prince William and Prince Harry with his older brother Prince William.

    "Body/Corps": "Mr. Goodale: What a wonderful idea, to request citizen input on such an important topic affecting all Canadians!! I will focus  my questions and thoughts on  prevention of radicalism.\n\n*\n\nQuestions   \nSince the bible and Islamic teaching seem to have similar tenets, what is there about the Islamic religious document that seems to incite such literal interpretations and so much intolerance which can lead to hatred, radicalism and violence?   \nWhy do so many Muslims have such vastly different beliefs about what it means to be a good Muslim? (This appears also to be largely at the root of so many of the constant warring factions among different Islamic groups).\nWhat are the education requirements and standards required to be an Iman? (Perhaps there should be clear understanding about those expectations in Canada)?\nCan the critical thinking we try to encourage in the Canadian school curriculum ever be compatible with Islamic beliefs? (It seems that Islam does not leave room for skepticism or questioning of the religious “book”).\nSome Thoughts\nIt doesn’t seem that Muslims want to admit that there is a major problem in their religious teaching, that allows for/encourages   such  dangerous  interpretations and subsequent justification of intolerance and violence.\nAll Imans should be focusing a great deal on encouraging and supporting Muslims to examine their intolerances and not to take their religious document literally. Muslims have as much to lose (or perhaps more), than non-Muslims when radicalism spews forth its ugliness.\nAlthough most Muslims would likely not identify with radicalism, they need to look deeply into many of the long-held beliefs some have, (and that they perhaps promote to their children), such as supposed male superiority and hatred of other religions and groups.\nCanadian “values” are real, and a source of pride to many Canadians. Our values also equate with our laws, so if these values are not respected, neither are our laws, and that is a big problem.\nI think that Islamic schools, as well as home schools can be definite risk factors in promoting radicalism and I question the current sufficient oversight into either. The Islamic school administrators continue to reiterate that they teach the Canadian curriculum, but, in spite of that, there is a great deal of flexibility permitted, and it would be very easy to emphasize the Islamic teachings. As I have mentioned, there   seems  to  discrepancies among Muslims as to how their 1400 year-old document is interpreted in today ‘s world.\nI have long maintained that prisons, with their high numbers of “lost souls” can be prime breeding grounds for radicalism.\nFinally, I have difficulty understanding how relevant such a stringent religious document can be in helping to navigate today’s complex world. I feel the same way about the bible, but for some reason, different interpretations of the bible do not seem to be a frequent cause of mass terrorism.",

We should lead by example and help set a new global standard for privacy protection in a digital age.\nI ask that my submission be given equal weight to all other submissions received by Public Safety during this consultation. Please consider this my response to the consultation question \"Do you have additional ideas or comments on the topics raised int his Green Paper and in the background document?\"\nThank you.\n*",
