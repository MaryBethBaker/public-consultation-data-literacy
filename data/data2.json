    "d": "Gosh, I think about government complacency with the atrocities of Canadian mining companies abroad, the treatment of the first nations young man who spent years in 24/7 light, and isolated from other humans, as well as decades of inside abuse of male and female RCMP members within the rank and file and I wonder if our government is qualified to even recognize radicalization.  So an exemplary example from our government in all departments is the first step in a national strategy.  Sadly, many people think morals, integrity do not matter or at least are optional.  That is where we need to begin.  Many of the newcomers to Canada are shocked with our lack of morals and worry about their children being raised in this country.  Yes better economic prospects for their children but at such a cost.   \nCanada once had a reputation for taking care of each other and citizens of the world.  In so many ways we have lost that, and now in the vacuum of social isolation or political honor individuals seek comfort where they can find it - often unsavory groups wishing to use them as fodder for their own nefarious causes.  \nTherefore a program that begins early and moves sustainable through all levels of schooling would be a big step.  All levels of school - primary, intermediate, middle, secondary, post-secondary need a mentor assigned to each student.  Someone who the student builds a trust relationship with over time.  Yes, this will cost money, but it could also be supplemented by volunteers who want to help - parents (not directly with their own child) retired folks, young people, other students.  Everyone, paid or volunteer, would receive initial and then continual training in diverse, applicable content area.  Learning such things as: Why humans need to feel we are of value more than almost anything else.  How to help individuals acquire a sense of value in their lives.  What are the signs of someone disengaging from Canadian values and society.  This training and experience as a mentor would enrich and educate our citizenry - a much needed first step - in addition to providing a trust relationship for each student.  \n\nSuch a network of people would be the surrogate noses for our country in both preventing radicalization and detecting it before it becomes a problem - violence.  Mental health issues - while they seldom lead to violence - often result in poor decision making.  If we were equipped to act on needs of individuals reaching out for help on their first try, rather than the current 3 - 10 years later when a disaster is occurring situation, it would also counter some who becomes radicalized due to mental health reasons.",
    "education and a harsh hand no more peace bonds worthless": "I do not understand this question.  Do you mean radicalization vs violence, or radicalization that leads to violence?  Sorry.  I can be of no help with this wording.  \nCertainly cleaning up all your own departments and Canada's own image abroad (mining companies for example) would be an excellent beginning.  Funding the creation of a structure for mentoring programs so lost individuals don't slip over to the radicals.  Honorable, transparent (lose the baffle garb) communications about what is happening through all media.  Try some good news stories.  People are completely saturated with negative, problem stories.  Help people regain pride in our country instead of the current despair that the new government is the same wolf in a different set of sheep's clothing.  Selfies, cute texts, and earnest looks lacking substantive details don't do it for me.  Too many promises made with baffle garb explanations of why they are not happening undermine people'e ability to sustain interest in persevering what is good in our society. \nIf we want to return to a time where Canadians take pride in their country and multi-culture, they must believe that they are not being played.  That is a basic requirement to individuals being the eyes and ears to protect our morals and values.",
    "f": "This is pretty much the song I have been signing throughout this document.  Begin at the base - children supported by knowledgeable, caring mentors. Dalai Lama said we would eliminate world violence in one generation if every child was taught to meditate.  That is another possibility.  Not a religious action but a mental-emotional-physical action that results in a peaceful outlook.  Thus putting mindfulness on the curriculum in every province, and subsidizing companies willing to introduce and sustain a mindfulness program in their work places, including mindfulness program for all immigrants, making it available free of charge to unemployed, retired etc.  Another possibility is providing support for all government housing (including immigrant housing) so there is someone who comes into make sure folks are emotionally fit and surviving as well as having a roof over their head and food for their stomach.  I believe there is a substantial body of research in this area showing the support is the key to making a difference in helping people adjust from the street to housing.  Different scenario but similar in that it is dealing with emotions.  Emotions are a gritty area of humanity that are easier for us to ignore than address.  We ignore emotions anywhere in society at our peril.",
    "g": "A communication medium that allows incoming rather than just the ponderous outgoing messages from the government.  Give your MPs specific questions to ask their constituents at town hall meetings, on their web sites, when door knocking between elections.  Listen to the results which need to come directly to an advisory group separate from the government rather than being filtered through a political party.  Have MPs join meetings with immigrants, indigenous peoples, different work organizations, to take your questions to and receive answers.  Our MPs are to represent all their constituents, so every opportunity the government has to give structure to that job is a good one for we the people.",
    "Have regular fact-finding missions to countries that are successfully battling terrorism.  Take those ideas back to Canada and have round tables to make recommendations to improve our programs.": "Research into identifying when the most basic and important of human needs are not being met.  I am pretty sure many who slip over into radical society have a deep human need that is met there.  Once you know these needs (such as being valued) how can Canadian society meet these needs.  Meeting basic needs of individuals is a lot cheaper than combating violence and it is a program applicable to many challenges across the country and across departments.  In short pretty good bang for your buck. I have suggested a few programs earlier such as student mentors, mindfulness programs throughout our society and support in housing.  These are just off the top of my head.  I am sure there are many proven programs.",
    "i": "I live in *.  At a town hall meeting there is often a turn out of 200 to 400 from a population of about 8000.  Citizens are engaged, knowledgeable and accepting.  So I now live in a community where radicalization is how to get more solar into the community.  \n*SWIS (Settlement Workers in the Schools) which worked to integrate the whole family into Canadian life, rather than just focusing on children in the schools.  Through this program I saw the stark emotional needs of the adults, which were not met as there were NO counselors able to work with them in their native language.  Women who had seen husbands and other family members brutally murdered, had repeatedly been raped themselves, had lived in refugee camps for decades and so had no sense of privacy etc.  These dear souls just sat in their apartments unpacking and unpacking the horrors of their lives.  Yes, they went out to buy food, get medical care, but there is very little planned in communities to engage them at the place of their emotional and mental capacity.  Creating Canadian type of gatherings and clubs doesn't mean a lot to them.  While we do want them to integrate, abandoning them when they can't learn English (often illiterate in their own language thus the whole written English approach has no neural connections for them) to their own devices, means we are also abandoning their ability to parent their children.  Their children straddle two cultures and hide from each culture what they don't want known/seen in the other culture.  We in our ignorance of what is happening in the lives of the parents and in the lives of the children blithely go our happy way congratulating ourselves on providing a program like SWIS.  We are unaware of the molten adversity gathering under our feet ready to erupt into violence.  So counselling being available for immigrants in their own language and family counselling for them is critical.",

Were we to accomplish this, their would be a staggering reduction in the radicalization of our youth towards violence.  So many of these youth have no jobs, no prospects, and see no hope.

I believe it's important to have the involvement of muslim converts to christianity at some level as they've often been the most vulnerable to political islamic jihadi violence globally. They also are required to love their enemies and would understand culturally some of our highest risk areas. Canadian heroes like Mubin Shaikh as well seem to offer thoughtful relevant perspective, strategy and tactics. One huge priority would be that the freedom to debate and critique Islam is not in anyway curtailed in Canada. That Sharia Law is not in anyway put in place. Also we need to be alert to Saudi funded Wahabi preachers and madrasas. Again, it's hard to discuss in this format as I imagine much of this is obvious and in place already so I'm not sure where I can best help by discussing.",

We now allow prayers in the school. But only Islamic prayers. Some kids report being bullied for not being muslim. Interesting. Who are the parents? This is the kind of thing that could easily go overlooked. One scientist Dr. Gad Saad of Concordia Montreal has said that he can predict when radicalization and violence become threats based on the percentage of population who take on an islamic identity. So demographics can be used to identify hotspot areas and allies within it. Now one mistake the US made in Afghanistan is allying with corrupt people. There would be US ally warlords who rape children. Obviously, that can't happen even in a less disturbing form.

Histories of violence which we have no record of. There is a marxist perspective that is growing in power, it frames all aspects of life where some succeed and others fail as corrupt because there is not an equality of outcome. Even if there is an equality of opportunity, it's believed that the winners oppress the losers. Even when they don't. So it rationalizes resentment and hate. Many people here will tell you to do diversity training, anti bias training and anti racism training�but there's actually evidence that shows that programs like these often INCREASE the very things they're meant to stop. People who aren't racist are treated as if they are, they become resentful and more likely to feel that there is ill will unfairly directed at them from other races and from the system itself. It's not good. Professor Dr. Jordan Peterson has much to say on this topic which has great value. He has studied self deception and the nature of evil. You have kids who are abused by parents. They show behavioural problems in school. But if the kid is black for example, perhaps people are too afraid of being labelled racist to look into the situation. These kinds of socially enforced darknesses increase risk to everyone. We should all be held to the same standard.",
