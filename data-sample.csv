469,2016-11-05 16:20,EN,"Recently, we experienced three major difficulties in the oversight actions of government officials:  RCMP - abuse of both male and female within the ranks and the First Nations youth incarcerated in isolation with lights on 24/7 for years.  These events do not give me confidence that much of anything in terms of oversight is happening.  One received an apology and a commitment to do better (female RCMP abuse) one I don't know of anything happening yet (male RCMP abuse) and the young 1st Nations man whose situation was not addressed until 13 more days had passed because an official did not want to interfere with the department.  That is his job to interfere when events go off the rails.   
I believe education up and down from the Minister to every staff member in every department is a fundamental requirement.  Next options for whistle blowers to come forward anonymously if necessary to keep off the rail events from dragging on for years.  Yes, anonymous means there will be false claims, but currently legitimate claims are often treated as false to maintain status quo.  This is akin to abolishing the death penalty so no one dies who is innocent, this is the same, all concerns treated as legitimate until proven false.   It is sheer arrogance for upper echelon leaders to think they know what is happening throughout their departments.  There needs to be an egalitarian communication system in place so real events are communicated and rectified.  When the topic impacted is our national security YIKES let's get this fixed.  Who knows how many taken for granted messes are haplessly confounding our national security because it is the way things have always been done.","I think multiple perspectives are always needed.  However, there is a difference in offering an opinion compared to being on the one who makes the decision.  I always have concerns with bureaucracies policing themselves.  Payback, promotions, requests made for assignment changes whether context or location, respectful communications with everyone are all at risk due to unsupervised and unaccountable power that individuals either are given by the system or acquire by being condoned bullies within the system.  
When it is our national security that is the focus, these thwarting actions cannot be allowed to be present.   I think creative, intelligent, MORAL, outsiders who have nothing to gain or lose, are critical people to have on any review body.  ","Every department that has anything to do with national security should be under regular review.  Internal best practices need to be scrutinized to make sure whistle blowers have a means to communicate concerns about anything:   processes, outcomes, communications whatever is seen as a concern.  
A hand written suggestion box although old fashioned is also effective in keeping minutia as well as major ideas flowing.  It is one way to make sure the processes that are happening are synchronized with what the public is being told is happening and with the best interests of our national security.  These suggestion boxes need to be opened by the group that has nothing to gain or lose, not by someone within the department who will scrutinize within their own departmental baggage lens. 
","Yes.  Our parliamentarians are so often party driven rather than people driven.  If we had a parliament of independent MPs it may work.  However, whenever vested interests, paybacks etc., could trump Canadian priorities and the priorities of Canadians, we need to have an independent body of highly moral, educated, skilled, creative individuals examining as well as reviews by people with vested interests such as Party MPs.",Three years - wow a lot of damage is done in a very short time - look at the omnibus bills of the previous government that swash buckled through so many Canadian protection laws.  3 years is too long unless there are anonymous communication systems in place allowing daily scrutiny and unless there is an independent review body of individuals with absolutely NOTHING to gain from any decision made.  The independent review body needs to be the group that receives the daily communications about whatever.,*,,British Columbia,Engaged citizen

If what 9/11 should have taught, is that interagency turf-protection and other reasons for not exchanging data are dangerous and that such data must be circulated to all agencies with national security responsibilities.","That all depends on the composition of the committee of Parliamentarians. There is a danger with a parliamentary committee that certain issues become partisan ones and genuine concerns are not addressed properly.  An independent, non-partisan body could overcome this, but would need to be seen as a neutral arbiter.",Likely not.

474,2016-11-07 12:37,EN,"I believe it is absolutely necessary to have an independent review body capable of operating and providing oversight in real-time with unlimited access to CSE, CSIS, and RCMP activities.  The independent review body would need the expertise to objectively weigh the rights of Canadians against the need to secure Canadians from threats, both foreign and domestic.  If the body determines an agencies actions are in violation of a Canadian's constitutional or legal rights without merit, the independent body should have the power to shut down the investigation immediately.","Yes, I absolutely believe that the review bodies should be permitted to collaborate on reviews given that our security agencies collaborate in their activities as well.  This is an absolutely necessary step given the modern security response to threats of national security.","Yes, more formal independent review mechanisms with teeth need to be developed to oversee the activities of all security agencies operating in Canada.  Their authority and parameters must be made clear and they should be instructed to lean towards the protection and preservation of every Canadians constitutional rights whenever the need to violate said rights is uncertain.","Yes, I believe an independent review body is still necessary as I believe that parliamentarians neither have the time nor adequate expertise to oversee the activities of the security agencies in real-time and from an objective, informed standpoint.  Parliamentarians are often too beholden to constituents who can easily be swayed by fear to surrender their rights in exchange for protection, even where such aggressive security measures are not, in fact, warranted.",Both the Prime Minister and the Minister of Public Safety need to be held accountable for any unwarranted violation of a Canadian's constitutional rights to ensure that proper measures are put in place to ensure that security agencies are more cautious in the exercise of their powers.,*,,Ontario,Academic
